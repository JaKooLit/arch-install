This is useful when you are dual booting and cant expand your boot partition.

Alternative install method


Usually, GRUB keeps all files, including configuration files, in /boot, regardless of where the EFI System Partition is mounted.

If you want to keep these files inside the EFI System Partition itself, add --boot-directory=esp to the grub-install command:

# grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=esp --bootloader-id=grub --boot-directory=esp --debug

This puts all GRUB files in esp/grub, instead of in /boot/grub. When using this method, make sure you have grub-mkconfig put the configuration file in the same place:

# grub-mkconfig -o esp/grub/grub.cfg

Configuration is otherwise the same.
